## Tema2 APD - README BONUS file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Scope and idea
  * the scope of the bonus implementation is for the level 1 workers to read
  previously assigned chunks of bytes from the input file, so that the reading
  is parallelized and the threads are not dependent on each other;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Brief description
  * in the main method, read the size of the orders input file;
  * when the level 1 tasks are created, the worker threads will receive the
  start and end (in bytes) of the position of where to start and stop reading;
  the start and end were calculated with a formula that ensured the interval is
  equal for each of the threads;
  * firstly, the worker thread will skip a number of bytes equal to the start
  value, so that it reaches the chunk of interest;
  * the convention is that each worker thread will read line by line (except
  for the first line) from the allocated interval, however because the lines
  are not equal, the reading will not stop at the end of the interval and is
  likely to stop a couple of bytes after; even if so, we ensure that this
  happens only for the line that was partially in its designated chunk and
  partially in the next designated chunk by always comparing the current file
  position with the end of the chunk; if the position is equal or further from
  the end, it means the thread has read all the designated lines, including the
  one that is in two different chunks;
  * as mentioned, the first line within the chunk will not be read by line but
  rather by bytes until reaching the new line character, so that for the corner
  case when the previous thread has stopped reading the last order right before
  the new line character, we will not skip the following line (which would
  happen if we were reading by line);
  * in order to ensure the order is valid, we check if it contains "o_", as
  this is the marking of the beginning of each order name; if it doesn't
  contain it, it means the previous thread has already read that order (this
  can happen only for the first order in the current thread's chunk);
